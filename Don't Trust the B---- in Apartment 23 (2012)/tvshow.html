Chloe's remedy for this is to slip June an herbal relaxant, but the next thing June knows, it's Tuesday and Monday is a complete blackout. As she tries to piece together what happened, June discovers some surprising things about herself. Meanwhile, James grapples with the idea that he may have impregnated June's friend, Crissy, on her wedding day.

It is Teddy, Chloe&rsquo;s childhood friend from Camp C.U.T.S. (Callous Unemotional Trait Survivors) who visits her every year when he goes off his medications. His visit coincides with the Carter Marsh Annual Warehouse Sale, where Chloe uses psycho and manic Teddy to her advantage against all the vicious out of town women at the sale. Meanwhile, James is devastated when he finds out that his Beek Jeans have been relegated to the &ldquo;cooling rack&rdquo; at the sale where no one is buying them.
